##Assignemnt 1: World Happiness Report 2019 - Advanced EDA with D3.js Visualizations

Overview
This project explores the World Happiness Report 2019 dataset from Kaggle. It includes performing an advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), utilizing both traditional Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as advanced D3.js visualizations for interactive insights. Aim is to push the limits of interactive data visualization by integrating D3.js into Colab to create dynamic visualizations, such as bar charts, scatter plot matrices, and a world map that visualizes the distribution of happiness scores across countries.

Key Features
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key statistics of the dataset.
Boxplot, Distribution Plot, and KDE Plot for Happiness Score and GDP per Capita.
Scatter Plot for Happiness Score vs. GDP per Capita with interactive elements.
Interactive Bar Chart showing Happiness Score vs. Overall Rank.
World Happiness Map with D3.js, showing the global distribution of happiness.
Interactive Bubble Chart to highlight relationships between Happiness Score, GDP, and Population size.

EDA Steps
* Loading and Inspecting the Dataset: Load the dataset, inspect the structure, data types, and summary statistics.
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers using the IQR method.
* Feature Engineering: Create a new feature categorizing happiness into Very Happy, Happy, and Unhappy.
* Data Visualization with Python: Use Boxplot, KDE, and Heatmap to explore key features.
* Advanced D3.js Visualizations: Implement interactive bar charts, scatter plots, world maps, and bubble charts to visualize key relationships.

Installation and Setup
### 1. Install the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install kaggle matplotlib seaborn
